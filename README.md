## Unpacking

The firmware files in this repository were extracted from the Juniper software distributon using ``binwalk -e``. The resulting files contains the raw x86 firmware, which can loaded into tools like IDA Pro. Data references in IDA Pro are incorrect due to some of section padding or alignment that occurs when the firmware is loaded into memory. This is still a TBD.
